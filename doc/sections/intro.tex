\section{Introduction}

As part of the course ``Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning'' at
Lappeenranta University of Technology, a project to classify digits written by
hand in 3D has been completed by a team of two students; \authorA{} and
\authorB{}. A training set of 1000 written digits was given to the team and a
classifier in the form of a multilayer perceptron was implemented and trained
using the set. The work and resulting classifier is documented in this report.
